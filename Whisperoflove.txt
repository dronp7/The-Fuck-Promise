From the moment our eyes first met,  
A spark ignited, one I won’t forget.  
You were sitting with light, and laughter with grace,  
A memory etched, that time can’t erase.

In that instant, my heart knew,  
There was something special, something true.  
Not just beauty, but a soul so bright,  
That made my world, fill with light.

Our first "Hello" was simple and sweet,  
But it was a memory, I'll always keep.  
Your words, your smile, that day you wished,  
Was like a treasure, my heart had missed.

And then, there was the day you left behind,  
A lunchbox that kept playing in my mind.  
Rushing to return it, shy yet bold,  
Your smile, so warm, worth more than gold.

But love’s journey isn’t always smooth,  
We faced fears, and doubts, yet proved,  
That even in the darkest night,  
Your memory was my guiding light.

Shikha, you’re the sun in my sky,  
The reason for every happy sigh.  
In your presence, colors bloom,  
You turned my world from gray to noon.

On this day, I promise you,  
To hold your hand, through and through.  
To be your rock, your guiding star,  
No matter where, no matter how far.

For you are my life, my beating heart,  
The one I cherish, never to part.  
Happy Birthday, my love, my light,  
With you, every day is just right.
