
Shikha Dron Pancholi,
     Every man has a phase of his life, when the simple beauty of his existence reveals itself in the form of another, a person so intertwined with his soul that all paths seem to lead to her, no matter what he does, it ultimately leads to her. Everything he does has an intention of impressing her or winning her. You, my Shikha, are that person for me. Like the moon guiding ancient sailors across treacherous seas, you have illuminated the darkest corners of my heart and led me to a love I never thought possible,I never thought did exist-

     In the grand histories of love, there have been tales of castles built for queens, wars waged for the love of a woman, and monuments raised in eternal memory, empires made and devastated for love. But what I offer you today is something far more profound—a love that surpasses stone and steel, a commitment that neither time nor death can erode, nothing in this universe can erase us from the history. I come to you not as a conqueror seeking glory, but as a man humbly asking to be the keeper of your heart, the partner in your journey, and the soul tethered to yours for all eternity. I'm here not to conquer your heart, but I beg for you and your heart.
It's all that I want in my life. You, just you, My love, My Shikha.

     Shikha, will you be my queen? Will you walk with me through the fleeting moments of this life and into the boundless eternity beyond? Just as empires have risen and fallen in the name of love, I would tear down every wall, cross every boundary, and defy the heavens themselves to hold your hand forever.

     What I ask of you today is more than a simple union of hearts. I ask you to become the other half of my soul, the North Star to which I will always turn. I offer you the fuck promise—the greatest vow I can give: that I shall never leave you, that I will be your constant, your shelter in life’s fiercest storms, and that in every breath I take, your name will be the one I cherish most.

     Like the great oaths sworn in the temples of ancient gods, let this promise stand as sacred. From this day forth, I am yours and you are mine, not just in this lifetime, but in every lifetime that may come. Together, we will carve our own legend into the annals of time, our love a beacon that will shine across the ages.

     Will you marry me, my Shikha? Will you allow me the honor of being yours, for now and for always, as we build a love story that no history could ever rival?

Only Yours and forever yours,
Dron Shikha Dubal.

A Poem for You

With this, I end with a small poem that speaks from the deepest part of my heart:

From the whispers of forgotten gods and kings,
Who carved their stories into winds and tides,
I summon love—more ancient than its wings,
To bind our souls, where all of fate resides.

In every myth, in every fabled land,
There bloomed a rose—an emblem fierce and true.
My Shikha, you’re the rose I long to stand,
Beneath, with heart unbroken, ever new.

In Persian gardens, love was like the moon,
A silver thread that ties us to the stars.
I, too, am bound, by every ancient rune,
That swore, ‘In love, no distance leaves us far.’

The Greeks knew love as fire that can’t be tamed,
And burned in temples where the gods would play.
But, my Shikha, ours, a fire still unnamed,
Will burn forever, bright as dawn’s first ray.

Now hear me speak, the Fuck Promise I lay bare,
A vow no gentle word could dare contain—
I’ll be your shield, your storm, your answered prayer,
Through every joy, and every searing pain.

For you are mine, in every breath and tear,
In nights of sorrow, and in days of gold.
I’ll guard you close, destroy your every fear,
Our love a flame that never shall grow cold.

And when the world forgets the names of kings,
And empires fall, their ruins lost to sand,
I’ll write our love in constellations' rings,
Forever traced across the heavens' hand.

So now, I kneel beneath this boundless sky—
The sun, the stars, the seas, all bear my plea.
Will you, my love, beneath this endless sigh,
Take all I am, and spend all life with me?

Yours and forever yours,
Your Dron.
