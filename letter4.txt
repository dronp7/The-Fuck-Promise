Hello Chikuu, 

I have been thinking about us a lot lately and there is something I want to tell you. I hope you know that I mean this in the most respectful and loving way.

For some people, I know certain things about looks don’t matter but for me it does. Everything about you matters to me. The smile, the eyes and yes the body too, but don't take it the wrong way, what I'm trying to say is boobs won't be a big deal for you, but for me it is more than a physical feature which can't be expressed by words,. Because that is who you are and I love every part of you. Your boobs aren’t just your boobs as a physical attribute; it’s part of you that i absolutely adore.
Don’t get self-conscious or take this the wrong way please. What I mean is that because I love your every inch so no matter how much we do,… you will still be incredibly sexy and attractive for more as ever.. You are perfect and words cannot describe how much i love you.
Please remember that the love I have for you has nothing to do with physical appearance, it is who you are as a person and the way you make me feel, the happiness you bring in my life everyday. Please don't think that I'm going after your body for something. I would never ask for your any other body part, but boobs for me is a different thing, I hope that you will understand and won't take it the wrong way. We can also discuss it our way. I know that you don't like all this stuff but I'm only asking for boobs, I should have added only but this is only the thing j beg to you and I urge for. Please try to understand.

Lovingly,
Vandrii
