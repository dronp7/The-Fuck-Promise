From the moment our eyes met, My love, My shikha,
I was no longer my own.
You, with the stars in your gaze,
Awoke something deep within me,
A fire I never knew could burn so bright.
You became not just the woman I wanted to love—
But the one I knew I had to be worthy of.
In that instant, the world around me dissolved,
And all that remained was the path that led to you,
Each step guided by the light in your eyes,
Each breath drawn in the hope of becoming the man you deserve.

From the very first moment I laid eyes on you,
I didn’t just see someone I wanted to hold;
I saw someone whose presence illuminated my world,
Someone I needed to deserve, to protect, to cherish.
In that single glance, my heart whispered truths I hadn’t yet known,
As if the universe conspired to lead me to you—
For in your eyes, I found the essence of every dream,
Where love and light, hopes and heavens, intertwined.
You are not just a treasure I stumbled upon,
But the guiding star I was destined to follow.

In your voice, I hear the melody of everything I’ve ever longed for,
It hums in the quiet moments when your name sits on my lips,
A symphony that crescendos with every word you speak.
You are the music that has turned my silence into song,
The echo of a thousand unspoken promises I hold close.
For in every glance, every touch, every breath we share,
I feel the depth of this love that only grows stronger,
Rooted in the soil of dreams we’ve yet to dream.

My love, My shikha, the day I returned your forgotten lunchbox
Wasn’t just a simple task; it was my heart’s way of showing
That even in the smallest moments, I cared.
In that smile you gave me, I found a universe of joy—
A joy that turned the simplest of acts into something eternal.
In your happiness, I found my purpose,
To always strive to keep that smile alive,
To be the reason behind it,
For your joy became my brightest light.

When distance grew between us, it wasn’t just your absence I mourned—
It was the loss of a connection I had only just begun to understand.
But in that quiet, I promised myself this:
Not to possess you, but to become the man
Who could stand beside you, through storms and sun,
A man you could trust with your heart.
For loving you, My love, My shikha, was not just about wanting—
It was about deserving, about fighting for the chance to stay,
To be there through the darkest nights
And hold your hand as we find the dawn together.

When you smile, the world shifts beneath my feet—
As if the universe itself bends to witness
The wonder of you, the grace in your every move.
I could live a thousand lifetimes, and still,
Your smile would be my salvation, my compass,
Guiding me through every uncertainty,
Every fear that dares to shadow the light of our love.
And in those silent days, when your absence was louder than words,
I didn’t just long for you—
I longed to grow into someone who could be your anchor,
Your safe harbor in a world full of storms.

I am not perfect, My love, My shikha, but for you, I strive—
Not just to love you, but to become someone worthy of your love.
For I know that love, real love, is not just about taking—
It is about giving, about becoming.
With you, I’ve learned that love is not a prize
