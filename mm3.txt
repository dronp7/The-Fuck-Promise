Helloo shikha,
      Good morning, my princess. I'm really sorry for last night that I didn't text you back. The reason behind it were boobs. Means I send you about boobs and you got uncomfortable. Then, I was little worried about that so I thought of leaving the chat for few mins, but at the end j wasn't able to text you back. I'm really sorry that i can't resist for your boobs and I often keep making you uncomfortable. I apologise and I'm guilty for that. I love you. Bye

Your Daddy,
Vandrii
