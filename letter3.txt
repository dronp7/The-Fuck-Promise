Dear Shikha,

From the moment I met you, my life changed forever. You’ve brought so much joy, love, and meaning into my world. I can’t imagine a single moment without you, and I never want to.

I promise, from the depths of my heart, that I will never leave you. I will stand by your side through every joy, every challenge, and every moment in between. Our special bond, our “fuck promise,” means everything to me. It’s a vow that I will always honor, ensuring that I’m always there for you, no matter what.

Shikha, will you marry me? Will you allow me the honor of spending the rest of my life with you, loving you, and keeping our promises forever?

With all my love,
DRON
