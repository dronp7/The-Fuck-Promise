Hello CHIKUU,
     I'm extremely sorry for my yesterday's mischief and I do commit that It was one hundred percent my fault. I do feel guilty right now for my deeds of yesterday and somewhere it's affected our 6 months anniversary. I'm so sorry for that. The reason I got so rude was that I couldn't resist when it comes to boobs and I often loose control over my mind. I shouldn't have been so rude with you and I'm never supposed to be rude with you or do anything which hurts you or makes you feel that I don't love you sometimes. I do love you from the bottom of my heart and I apologise for my yesterday's deeds. I know it's hard for you to get convinced, but I don't wanna spoil our 6 months anniversary. I know there is no may to correct this mistake but I'm trying to control myself over it. Please accept my apologies. I will try my best not to repeat it again, but you know that sometimes I can't control myself over the boobs. But, if I again talk about it, I won't be rude to you. I assure it. I hope our 6 months anniversary will be full of love and you have to read the 11th point of fp on VC remember that.

Absolutely yours,
Vandrii
