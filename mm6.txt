My Rocket,
     MORNING MY ROCKET, I hope you had a great launch today so that you could have your eyes on me today and we could establish blushing eye contacts&#128073;&#128072;&#129325;. I'm sorry for yesterday but messages were not being delivered and idk why but j keep getting fever, and so did yesterday at night, I got fever in no time, so I slept at around 1. I'm so sorry that I went without informing you, but you know what, I love you the most unique way, my most beautiful and adorable princess &#129292;&#129292;&#129728;. You mean the world to me. Please establish eye contacts and see by my side atleast for today, so that I could make my day, very nicely.

Your Vandrii
