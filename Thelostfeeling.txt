So the bad phase still continues and I had lost myself as I lost you and I was not sure whether you would come back or not. This was the time when I felt very low and I was guilty that even if I had some interest in you, keeping it aside for some time and still I should not have let anything such thing done with any other girl. I don't know if you cried after this or not. Or you were furious over me, I don't know. If anything I knew at that time, was the guild and regrets I had deep in my heart. At that time I tried to pretend like nothing just happened and you never existed before. For a few days in school, I acted like you didn't exist. I couldn't resist seeing you but it was my feelings that what would happen if I'd lose you. I resisted myself from turning my face towards you for a few days, after a week or so I simply just couldn't resist.

     I saw you in secret and thought of texting you on Instagram. As you didn't block me there. But I wasn't just able to gather that courage to text you as I had the fear of losing you completely in my deep conscience. I also felt myself convicted for this. But I was helpless. I could take a step of texting you because of my fear. So, after a few days, I had so much guilt and regrets, I just lost interest from everything, now anything in this world couldn't make me happy unless a text from you. I had lost complete interest in this boring life and I was just taken away with regrets. One of the worst phases in my life, if there was any other girl In your place, I'd have left her and might not regret that even if it was dhriti in your place. So, now I understood that my heart had some other plans for you or something like that. So what were your feelings when you blocked me? How did you feel for the whole time or nothing just happened for you like it was not a big deal for you?
