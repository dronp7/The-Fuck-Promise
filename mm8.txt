My princess,
     Morning my princess, I'm really sorry for yesterday as I slept without informing you, cz I had cold and my nose... Ah just leave it. Like I should have waited for you, nd I did till 11, but then I went to sleep, I'm really sorry for not letting you know that I went to sleep. Sorry for making you wait. Nd the sports days is postponed I guess, so we still have some time for that nd coming 1st isn't that easy but, I'll try best for you, my princess&#129728;&#129728;. Byee, I have tutions nd prepare for the test babee. 

Your Daddy
