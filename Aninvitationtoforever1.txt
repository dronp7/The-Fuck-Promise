From the very first moment I laid eyes on you,
I didn’t just see someone I wanted to have; I saw someone I needed to deserve.
In that single glance, I felt my world shift,
As if everything before you had been leading me to this moment,
For in your eyes, I found my universe, where love and light intertwine,
A treasure more precious than gold, a reflection of the divine.


When I first spoke to you, it wasn’t just words exchanged;
It was the beginning of something deeper, something I couldn’t yet name.
I realized then, it wasn’t enough to just talk to you —
I had to become someone worthy of your attention, your laughter, your time.
Every glance exchanged is a whisper of the heart,
And in your laughter, I hear the music of my soul, a melody that won’t depart.


Returning your forgotten lunchbox seemed like a simple task,
But it was a chance, a moment where I could show you,
That even in the smallest gestures, my care for you was real,
And in your smile, I found all the reward I needed.
In that simple act, my heart raced with delight,
For your joy was the sun that turned my day bright.


When distance grew between us, I didn’t just mourn the loss of connection;
I mourned the fact that I hadn’t yet become the man who could hold you close.
Yet even then, in the quiet, I prayed for strength,
Not to possess you, but to become someone you could trust.
I feared losing you, for I had not yet earned the right,
To fight for us, to hold you close through the longest night.


In those silent days, when I felt the weight of your absence,
It wasn’t merely longing that filled my heart, but a determination to be better.
For I knew, even then, that love wasn’t just about wanting —
It was about deserving every moment shared, every glance exchanged.
You are the light that guides me through the darkest night,
In your presence, all my fears take flight.


You became the reason I wanted to grow,
The one I wanted to stand tall beside, with pride and purpose.
For in you, I saw a future — not one I would merely stumble into,
But one I would work tirelessly to earn, day by day.
With you, I have discovered the meaning of true love;
A bond that transcends time, like the stars that shine above.


When you unblocked me, it wasn’t just a reopening of a channel;
It was hope restored, a second chance to show you that I had changed.
In that moment, I didn’t just feel relief;
I felt the weight of my promise to be worthy of your trust.
You are my today and all of my tomorrows,
In your gaze, I see the dreams that conquer my sorrows.


You are more than just beautiful to me;
You are the kind of person who makes others want to rise to their best.
Every time I’m near you, I don’t just admire who you are —
I strive to become the man who deserves to be at your side.
With every heartbeat, my love for you blooms like a wildflower,
In the garden of my heart, you are my greatest power.


Through cold December days, when love felt distant,
I kept my heart warm with thoughts of you, knowing that
True love is not built in the easy days but forged in the fire of perseverance,
And I would wait, work, and grow for as long as it took.
For you are my sun, my moon, and all my stars,
With every breath I take, my heart shouts how lovely you are.


When we fought, I didn’t just fear losing you;
I feared that I had not yet earned the right to fight for us.
And even in the hardest moments, my heart held tight to one truth —
That love is not just given; it must be earned through care, through effort.
For you, my darling, are my heart's desire, my dreams, my everything,
And in every disagreement, I find a deeper understanding.


In every look you gave me, in every smile shared,
I saw not just affection but a chance to prove myself worthy.
To be the man who can stand beside you with confidence,
Knowing that I have earned your trust, your heart, your love.
Your touch ignites a fire that never fades,
In your embrace, I find the whispers of forever, our love cascades.


On that day, when our hearts spoke the truth we had long known,
I didn’t just rejoice in hearing the words;
I rejoiced in knowing that I had taken the steps to deserve them.
For love is not just about receiving; it’s about becoming worthy of every gift it brings.
With you, I have found the piece of my heart that I never knew was missing,
In the rhythm of your laughter, I find my spirit's blissful singing.


You are the foundation on which my life is built,
The person who inspires me to rise above the ordinary.
In you, I see the reason for every effort I make,
Not just to hold you close, but to be someone you can always rely on.
You make me want to be a better man, to cherish and adore,
To give you my heart and soul, now and forevermore.


At first, I wasn’t sure if I was enough for you,
But with every passing day, I realized that love isn’t about perfection;
It’s about striving, growing, and becoming someone who earns your heart anew,
Every single day, with every word and every action.
You are my light in the shadows, my guiding star in the night,
In your eyes, I see the reflection of all that is right.


In moments of doubt, I wondered if I was worthy of your love,
But instead of letting fear control me, I let it push me to be better.
For I know that love is not something to be taken for granted,
It is something to be honoured, cherished, and continuously earned.
Every heartbeat, every sigh, is a promise made true,
For you are the poem I never knew how to write, my love, my muse.


And now, with every breath, I make this promise:
To never stop striving to be the man you deserve,
For you are my greatest love, my truest purpose,
And in your heart, I have found the reason for all I do.
So here I stand, with an open heart and soul,
For you are my forever, my love, my ultimate goal.


In the intricate tapestry of our shared journey, fate has woven our souls together,
From the very first moment my eyes beheld you, I realised my heart was irrevocably captured.
You are not simply a desire I wish to possess;
You are the embodiment of beauty, a treasure more precious than gold.
With each laugh we’ve shared and every stolen glance,
I have come to understand that my love for you is no mere coincidence.
In your presence, I find solace, my fears begin to dissolve,
A sanctuary of warmth where my heart can safely rest.

From the very first moment I set eyes on you, you were nothing but something that I felt mine. I didn’t just want to have you; I wanted to deserve you. For the first time in my life, I realized that asking God for you, while feeling unworthy, seemed almost disrespectful. Instead, I prayed for the strength to be worthy of you, and to be yours and only yours, to be someone who could honor the beauty, grace, and light that you bring into this world.

In your holy and precious presence, I felt something more than just desire — it was a yearning to grow, to become the best version of myself, to give you the best of any man could give you, it was my own competition to be the best among all, so that I could stand beside you with pride. You see, it wasn’t enough to simply wish for your love; I needed to become a man who could match the greatness I saw in you, I was sure you're the only one that will complete me, make me the real man. Every glance, every smile you gave me, only deepened my resolve, I fell harder and harder. I didn’t want to take your heart lightly, for I knew how precious it was, I could protect it more than myself.

As time passed, slowly but steadily I came to understand that loving you wasn’t just a matter of chance; it was a privilege that required the strongest dedication and care. And so, I will always continue to strive, every day, every single passing moment, I pray the mighty lord to be worthy of you — not just because of the way you make me feel, and gives me the feeling which I could never express, but because of the person you are. You deserve a love that is deep, unwavering, and true, and I have vowed to be that for you, to be everything you want, need, and desire for. I want to be the one for you.

In you, I have already found the one I wish to protect, to cherish, and to grow alongside, in each other's arms. You are not simply someone I wish to hold close; you are the only  one I aspire to be worthy of, every moment of my life. For this reason, I will never stop working to be the man you deserve, the man who never lets you down, because only you are, and will always and only be, my greatest love and my greatest purpose.
