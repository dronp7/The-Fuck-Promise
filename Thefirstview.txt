The time I re-joined the school was 9th standard. As you already know I'm a very introvert type of a  guy  to the people with whom I haven't come across yet. On the first day, I still remember when I first saw you. The first academic day was about to end. There were only about 15 minutes remaining until the final bell rang, so I just decided to have a view around the class and see everyone's face whether I know anyone or not and suddenly you just came in the frame of my eyes and caught it's attention completely, sitting on the left side of last second bench of middle row having a funny chat with Fatema.

     In no time after seeing you, something clicked in my mind that I should know more about that girl who is just going mad and furious, not having any fear of what people will think of her, and personally this one thing in you, left a nice impetus on my mind, making me more and more curious to know more and more about you. But honestly, I didn't see you from the perspective of loving you or having any idea about being with you in the near future. But I really don't understand why there was a curiosity to know more and more about you in my deep conscience.

     So, if I say what was my perspective towards you, I'd say it was quite different from others as I had no attention towards you earlier but on the other hand, I was eager to know everything about you, which made me observe you very carefully like an art or something precious. Really for me, which is very strange as I don't take any interest in others but I don't know why you made me think of you at the first glance itself. So, I can say that you had got the best start anyone could possibly get and you were also going to dominate my mind in many ways. You'll know it as you'll read further about how you left the incredible impression of yours at the first glance, getting all of my attention in the first time itself.
