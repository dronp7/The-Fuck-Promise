Hello CHIKU,
     I'm extremely sorry for my yesterday day's very rude behaviour and I do apologise for my rude behaviour, as I'm not supposed to be rude with you but still I guess I got really frustrated at you for no good reason. AND I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY MY FAULT. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS OF TEXTING ME EVEN WEHN YOUR PARENTS ARE AROIND AND YOU ARE FREE ONLY FOR 5 MINS BUT YOU ARE TEXTING ME FOR THAT 5 MINS. I GUESS IV'E GOT THE BEST GIRL IN THE WORLD. Now I'm realising my mistake that I should not have taken yesterday's your (atyare vaat nai Thai&#128517;&#128517;&#128517;) message that rudely. Please do forgive me for this time and I promise you that I won't let it happen next time. I know at the end of the day you will forgive me as you love me from the bottom of your heart &#128513;&#128513;.

      The reason I got frustrated at you was that I was waiting for you since previous night when you promised to chat or have a conversation yesterday. So, I was very exited, but when you said that you can't talk I got frustrated and I even don't know why. I can explain it to you in detail if we can have a call

Lovingly,
Vandrii
