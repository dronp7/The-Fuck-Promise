Here's a special letter for you as the 5th September has arrived, and also my princess took her first breath in the world of my presence.

To My Princessssss, My Shikha 
I don’t know exactly how to feel right now with our special day fast approaching or rather is here. But today I’ll try the best I could just to let you know the extent of how special you are in life.

First time I set eyes on you was the very first moment that knocked me out. You were sitting on that bench, giggling with your friend and I felt in me as if the world has hit me in my stomach. clicked. Thus I say it was not only your beauty that compelled me but the twinkle in your eyes and the radiance of your smile. After that I have started dreaming of you and the only thing that I can remember from my dreams is your name.

Let me tell you that the first time we spoke I was really impressed. It started with a “Hello” and I recalled how that tiny gesture – the most basic sign of greeting – made me experience such a feeling of affection that I still feel it even now. It will always remain one of my favorite memories and each time I find myself missing you, I always think of it. That’s why when you said happy birthday to me it felt like you were offering me the most priceless treasure of all, your company.

With all the wonderful things that had been transpiring, there was one with the lunch box which came out as memorable. You left it behind, and I was so happy; I felt this urge of having to get it for you. The happy look on your face when I returned it – Shikha, that glance made my heartbeat ten times faster than the speed of light. And speaking of that, time, it was in that moment that I knew that I want you in my life, not only as a friend – as someone I would barely see anyway – but as someone who would become the most important person in my life.

However, I would like to make it clear that our journey has not been a smooth one, but rather a challenging one. Sometimes I almost lost you because of fear and doubt that almost drove us apart most of the times I went on grappling with me insecurities. But even in those moments I knew that dreaming about you kept me alive. That was something I could not afford to lose so the very thought of it terrified me, and made me understand how much I actually love you. But this was not simply a case of adolescent infatuation or puppy love, no this was the real thing, the kind that stays with you for a lifetime.

There must be so much color around you Shikha; you have certainly brightened up my life which used to be so monotonous and gray. From you, I’ve learnt about true love and the feeling of being loved. I want to share with you the best that I can offer because, for you, I desire the best of everything, not just now but in the future as well.

On your birthday, I want to make you a promise. I promise to spend every day striving to make you as happy as you’ve made me. I’ll be your rock, your confidant, your biggest supporter, and your safe haven. I’ll be there to hold your hand through every challenge and to celebrate every joy with you.

My darling wife, Shikha, you are the thumping pulse of my dear life. Thanks to you I see the ways in darkness, and feel the comfort of the sun’s rays in the coldest days. The thought of living for a day without your existence in this world is unimaginable. You are not only my soulmate, or the woman whom I cherish most in this entire world, but you are my life itself.

That is the end of my appreciation; I still want to say thank you for being yourself. Just for being with me and for making me laugh even in my worst days, and for sticking by me even if I am intolerable at times. I want to say ‘I love you’ more than anything in the world and I’m so fortunate that you are always with me.

Happy Birthday, my love. Happy birthday to a person that I want to spend many more birthdays with, create lots of new memories together, and share my love throughout the rest of my days!!!

I often wake up thinking about you and the different moments that we have shared together in the past. You know my darling, there are those moments that make me smile and I tell to myself how lucky I am to have you in my life.

You make every dull day filled with so much love and joy, making everything we do, extraordinary. In the sound of your voice, I see us in our bubble, isolated and emotionally fed by love and that’s why I love hearing it. It feels like there is only love between us which connects us into our own universe of love. The moment you open that lovely pair of eyes to look directly into my own, I realize I have somewhere to be now, somewhere I am wanted, necessary, loved. I find my home in you, My love, My Shikha.

Shikha, from point of touching me, to smiling at me and doing every little thing with me brings me an inexplicable happiness. They also speak about love in such an unique way that I do feel my heart beating as if I am racing and could only be possible if it were racing in love with you.

I know I often look at you, not because being with me is all you could want, but because as you always seem to make even the most mundane moments magical. But it is like you make everything in your surroundings come to life, and I can hardly believe my luck that I am a part of your life.

You are the dream I never want to wake up from, Shikha. What you do to me goes beyond words, it goes beyond any feeling I have ever experienced. You have opened up a new dimension in my heart, a dimension where love is boundless and joy is timeless.

Thank you for waking the child in me, the dreamer in me, by teaching me the existence of such a thing as love and that the world is not such a terrible place after all. I do appreciate all you have been to me, thank you for being mine.

You are my greatest adventure, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us. I love you more than words could ever express, and I’m excited for every moment we have yet to share.

Yours and forever yours,
Your Daddy.
