From the moment our eyes met, I was no longer my own.
You, My love, My shikha, with the stars in your gaze,
Awoke something deep, a fire I didn’t know could burn so bright.
You became not just the woman I wanted to love—
But the woman I knew I had to be worthy of.
In that instant, the world around me dissolved,
And all that remained was the path that led to you,
Each step guided by the light in your eyes,
Each breath drawn in the hope of becoming the man you deserve.

In your voice, I hear the melody of everything I’ve ever longed for.
It hums in the quiet moments when your name sits on my lips,
A symphony that crescendos with every word you speak.
You are the music that has turned my silence into song,
The echo of a thousand unspoken promises that I hold close.
For in every glance, every touch, every breath we share,
I feel the depth of this love that only grows stronger,
Rooted in the soil of dreams we’ve yet to dream.

My love, My shikha, you are more than just a desire.
You are the horizon I chase, the sunrise that paints my skies.
Each day spent near you feels like eternity’s gift,
A reminder that time cannot wither what is true.
I have seen you in a hundred different ways,
Each more beautiful than the last,
And in each version of you, I find myself wanting
To be a better man, one who can stand beside you,
And walk through the storm and sunshine with hands entwined.

When you smile, the world shifts beneath my feet—
As if the universe itself bends to witness
The wonder of you, the grace in your every move.
I could live a thousand lifetimes, and still,
Your smile would be my salvation, my compass,
Guiding me through every uncertainty,
Every fear that dares to shadow the light of our love.

I am not perfect, My love, My shikha, but for you, I strive—
Not just to love you, but to become someone worthy of your love.
For I know that love, real love, is not just about taking—
It is about giving, about becoming.
With you, I’ve learned that love is not a prize to be won,
But a journey, a vow renewed with every sunrise.
And in the quiet hours of the night,
When the world is still and the stars whisper their secrets,
I hear your name in every heartbeat,
And I am reminded that you are my forever.

When I imagine the future, I see it with you—
Not just beside me, but intertwined with every dream I hold.
You are my muse, the reason I believe in tomorrow.
Together, we will write a story that no time can erase,
A love that will be whispered by the winds long after we are gone.
For in you, I have found not just love,
But the reason for all my seeking,
The answer to every question my heart has ever asked.

My love, My shikha, my heart’s horizon,
I vow to love you with all I am and all I will ever be.
In this life and the next, you are my constant, my always.
And as the stars watch over us tonight,
I know that our love will outshine them all—
Brighter than any celestial body,
A flame that will never fade,
Burning eternal, just as my heart burns for you.
