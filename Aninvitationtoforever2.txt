From the very first moment I laid eyes on you, My love, My shikha,
I didn’t just see someone I wanted to hold;
I saw someone whose presence illuminated my world,
someone I needed to deserve, to protect, to cherish.
In that single glance, my heart whispered truths I hadn’t yet known,
As if the universe, in all its mysteries, had conspired
to lead me to you—
For in your eyes, I found the essence of every dream,
Where love and light, hopes and heavens, intertwined.
You are not just a treasure I stumbled upon,
But the guiding star I was destined to follow.

When I first spoke to you, it wasn’t just words.
It was the beginning of a symphony,
A melody only we could hear, soft and delicate,
Weaving through time.
In that moment, I didn’t just speak to you—
I made a silent vow to become the man worthy of your laughter,
Your time, your love.
And every smile you’ve shared with me since
Has become the rhythm of my soul,
A pulse that grows stronger with each passing day.

My love, My shikha, the day I returned your forgotten lunchbox,
It wasn’t just a simple task; it was my heart’s way of showing
That even in the smallest moments, I cared.
In that smile you gave me, I found a universe of joy—
A joy that turned even the simplest of acts
Into something eternal.
In your happiness, I found my purpose,
To always strive to keep that smile alive,
To be the reason behind it,
For your joy became my brightest light.

When distance grew between us, it wasn’t just your absence I mourned—
It was the loss of a connection I had only just begun to understand.
But in that quiet, I promised myself this:
Not to possess you, but to become the man
Who could stand beside you, through storms and sun,
A man you could trust with your heart.
For loving you, My love, My shikha, was not just about wanting—
It was about deserving, about fighting for the chance to stay,
To be there through the darkest nights
And hold your hand as we find the dawn together.

In those silent days, when your absence was louder than words,
I didn’t just long for you—
I longed to grow into someone who could be your anchor,
Your safe harbor in a world full of storms.
And I knew, even then, that love isn’t something to be taken lightly—
It’s earned, through care, through patience, through every shared glance.
You are the light that leads me, My love, My shikha,
Through every shadow, every doubt.

You are the reason I strive to be better.
In you, I found the kind of love that inspires,
A love that pushes me to grow taller, to be stronger,
Not just for myself, but for you.
In your presence, I’ve seen the future—
Not as a place we will simply reach,
But as a journey we will walk together, hand in hand.
And with you, My love, My shikha, I’ve discovered what love truly means—
A bond that surpasses the confines of time,
Like the stars that light up the heavens, our love shines bright.

When you unblocked me, it wasn’t just a reopening of communication—
It was the spark of hope, the beginning of a new chapter.
I knew, in that moment, that I had been given a chance
Not just to speak to you again, but to show you that I had changed,
To prove to you that I had become someone worthy of your trust.
And with every beat of my heart, I knew that you were
Not just my today, but all my tomorrows.
For in your eyes, I see the reflection of dreams,
Dreams we will chase together, with every step we take.

You are more than just beautiful, My love, My shikha—
You are the kind of soul who makes the world brighter,
The kind of woman who makes others strive to be their best.
Every time I’m near you, I don’t just admire who you are—
I find myself becoming the man I always wanted to be.
For in your presence, my love blooms like a flower
That will never fade, its roots deep in the garden of my heart.

Through cold December days, when love seemed far away,
I held onto the thought of you,
Knowing that true love isn’t built in the easy days
But is forged in the fires of patience and perseverance.
And I would wait, My love, My shikha, for as long as it takes—
For you are my sun, my moon, and all my stars.
In every breath I take, your name echoes in my heart,
A sweet refrain that will never fade.

When we fought, I feared not just losing you—
I feared that I hadn’t earned the right to fight for us.
But even in the hardest moments, I knew this—
That love, true love, is not just given; it’s earned,
Through every word, every action.
For you, my love, My shikha, are the dream I never knew
Could be real. And in our disagreements,
I found deeper truths, a deeper connection.

In every look you give me, in every smile,
I see a world of possibilities, a chance to become
The man who stands beside you, strong and sure.
And every time you touch me, I feel a fire—
A fire that burns not just with passion,
But with the promise of forever.

And now, with every breath I take, I make this vow:
To never stop striving, to never stop becoming
The man you deserve.
For you are my greatest love, my truest purpose,
And in your heart, My love, My shikha, I’ve found the home I’ve always sought.
So here I stand, with an open heart and open soul,
Promising to love you, to cherish you,
Now, and for all the days to come.
