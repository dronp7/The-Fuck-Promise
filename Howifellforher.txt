-----HOW I FELL FOR HER-----
When I sit in the room of silence,
I think, Every moment is dream fulfilled.
In your arms, I find my solace,
I saw myself completely built.
--------
Your presence is sunrise to my soul.
Me being  completely lost within you,
It looks like my heart can't control.
And I don't have any clue.
--------
I seek my life in you for eternity,
If you have the clarity.
Each moment spent by your side,
A cherished journey, a love so wide.
--------
In the tapestry of memories, our love may prosper,
With each passing moment, We fall for us harder.
Hand in hand, we'll travel the life over the trust,
In each other's arms, on our eternal crust.
--------

JUST TRSUT ME!!
I WON'T EXPLOIT YOU.
DON'T BE CONCERNED FOR ANYTHING CZ I'M ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.
THERE IS NO AGE FOR LOVE 
JUST ENJOY IT WHENEVER YOU FEEL IT.
IF YOU WANT TO BE PHYSICAL ON YOUR CONVINCE THEN YOU CAN, BUT IF U DON'T THEN JUST LET ME KNOW IT.
I'll ALWAYS STAND AFTER YOU, EITHER IT'S A HUMAN OR THE WORLD.
IF YOU LET ME TOUCH YOUR BOOBS...&#128579;&#128579;

TO MY LOVING SHIKHA
